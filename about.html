      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I’m Lily, a curious go-getter exploring branding and web design at Capilano University’s IDEA School of Design. I value variety in my projects, with a soft spot for social good, arts and culture, and bold creative choices. Funky type, neons, and clever copywriting are my jam. Outside the artboard, you’ll find me planning a wicked double feature or crafting an “experimental” makeup look — likely salvaged by glitter.</p>
      <h5>Testimonials</h5>
